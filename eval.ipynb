From what I remember, banker's gain is the difference between the present worth (PW) and the true discount (TD) when the time is more than one year. But in this case, the time is 3 years, which is more than one year, so it might still apply.\n",
      "\n",

      "Let me denote the present worth as PW. Then, the amount due after 3 years would be PW plus the true discount (TD), which equals the amount due in 3 years. So, PW + TD = Amount.\n",

      "\n",
      "The formula for banker's gain (BG) is:\n",

      "BG = (PW × r × t) / (100 - (r × t))\n",

So, for example, if the actual number is 350, rounding to the nearest 10 would give us 350, but wait, 350 is already a multiple of 10.
